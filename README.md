Simple Poker Hands Identifeir using Java

Note that all poker hand identifiers are classes on their own, this is inefficient but each class contains all its own bugs.
But now that all hands are correctly identified and tested, it will be an easy task to merge all classes into one, resulting in one time hash table creation and quick identification.

I will leave that final task to the readrs.
