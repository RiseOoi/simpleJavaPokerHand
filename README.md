Simple Poker Hands using Java

Note that the Royal Straight Flush and Full House are not implemented yet.
And the end Straight (10, J, Q, K, A) isn't implemented correctly too.
Also note that all poker hand identifiers are a class on their own, which is not efficient.
I plan to merge them all together later on.

I have new gigs coming up the evening I first uploaded this file so I can't update/upgrade the codes.
Please wait for a while.
